Implementation of a quantum neural network for my Bachelor Thesis_

In order to get this script to work, you need the following:

Python 3.9

Tensorflow

Strawberry Fields

matplotlib


if you are using anaconda,
you can create a new environment via:


conda create -n 'env_name' python=3

conda activate 'env_name'

pip install strawberryfields

pip install tensorflow

pip install matplotlib

qnn.py is able to learn functions, 
operator.py learns a random unitary
and 2d learns the multiplication of 2 quantum registers.
